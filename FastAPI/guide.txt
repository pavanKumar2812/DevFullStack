### FastAPI

FastAPI: FastAPI is a modern, high performance python web framework designed for building APIs quickly and efficiently. 
         Build on Startlette (for web parts) and Pydantic (for data validation), it's known for simple, easy to use, automatic API documentation generation with Swagger UI and ReDoc.

Unlike Flask and Django, FastAPI is specifically optimized for building APIs with automatic type checking, validation and asynchronous support.

# ------------------
Features of FastAPI:
Five most important features that makes FastAPI popular
    1: High Performance: Build on modern python async features, FastAPI handles thousands of requests per second with ease.
    2: Type Safety: Python type hints to validate inputs automatically, reducing developer mistakes.
    3: Automatic Documentation: Generates interactive API docs (/docs and /redoc) without extra work.
    4: Asynchronous Support: Fully supports async and await, making it great for real-time applications.
    5: Build-in security: Supports authentication methods like OAuth2, JWT and API keys out of the box.

API - Application Programming Interface

An API is a set of rules that allows different softwares to communicate with each other. 
Think of it's a bridge that connects two systems such as a client and a server, and enables then to work together.

Today, over 80% of modern web applications reply on APIs to fetch the data, integrate with third-party services, or enabling features like login, payments, or real-time updates.
APIs play a curial role in building flexiable, scalable and connected software systems.

=> Why do we need the APIs?
    APIs helps developers to create software programs more easily. Instead of writing complex code from scratch, they can call the APIs that already provide the functions they need
